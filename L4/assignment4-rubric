Assignment 4 Rubric

Part I - 5 points

Question 1 - 3 points. Implement inheritance correctly with the ID generation
and correct instantiation (2 points)

This is going to be a little weird since CargoCycle being a subclass of 
Bicycle is going to cause some problems and inconsistencies. There are 
various ways of doing this. Some people might allow bicycles to have their
number of wheels changed. Others might override the getWheels/setWheels methods
and create a separate field for that, along with cargo space. I am
flexible here...

Correct toString method implementation (1 point)

Question 2 - 2 points

Conceptually, IDs are not to be counted as
an equals() factor. Looking at motorcycle accessories matching might be a bit
challenging. The best way is to sort the arrays of strings and compare them
one by one.

Part II - 5 points

Question 1

a. 1 point. Create the vehicle objects. Self explanatory. Make sure they
line up with what the instructions say

b. 1 point.  Sum up the cargo space values and divide by the number of objects to get the result`

c. 2 points. There are different ways of doing this. One way is to use a for loop
and record the indexes for which equals() is true, and then delete those items. Another way
is a while loop that selectively increments the index depending on whether a matching item
is found and removed or not. Remove one point if you don't mark which item is the SAME
object as the first blue car.

d. 1 point. Pretty straightforward. The remaining objects shouldn't have
blue cars in it.
